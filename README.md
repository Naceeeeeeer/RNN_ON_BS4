# Arabic Text Classification with NLP and RNNs
## 1. Data Collection
### Web Scraping:
Utilize scraping libraries such as Scrapy or BeautifulSoup to gather text data from various Arabic websites on a specific topic.
### Dataset Preparation:
Construct a dataset with columns for text and corresponding scores (0 to 10) indicating the relevance of each text.
## 2. NLP Preprocessing Pipeline
### Tokenization:

Implement tokenization to break down text into individual words or subwords.
### Stemming and Lemmatization:

Apply stemming and lemmatization to reduce words to their base or root form.
### Stop Words Removal:

Eliminate common stop words from the text data.
### Discretization:

Convert the continuous score values to discrete categories if needed.
## 3. Model Training
### RNN, Bidirectional RNN, GRU, LSTM:

Build models using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Bidirectional RNN, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures.
### Hyperparameter Tuning:

Fine-tune hyperparameters for each model to optimize performance.
## 4. Model Evaluation
### Standard Metrics:

Evaluate models using standard classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
### BLEU Score:

Employ BLEU score, a metric commonly used in machine translation, to evaluate the quality of generated text against reference text.
# Summary
This project involves collecting Arabic text data, preparing a dataset with relevance scores, implementing an NLP preprocessing pipeline, and training RNN-based models. Evaluation is performed using standard classification metrics along with BLEU score for a comprehensive assessment of model performance on the Arabic text classification task.
